# Key Concepts ðŸ”‘
- Cisco networking devices run the **[[IOS]]** operating system and are administered mainly through the **[[CLI]]**.  
- The IOS hierarchy includes **[[User EXEC mode]]**, **[[Privileged EXEC mode]]**, **[[Global configuration mode]]**, and several subâ€‘modes for interfaces and lines.  
- Secure management uses **[[SSH]]** instead of **[[Telnet]]**, and passwords are protected with **[[service passwordâ€‘encryption]]** and (where possible) `enable secret`.  
- Essential device hardening includes setting a unique **[[Hostname]]**, configuring console/VTY passwords, and adding an **[[MOTD banner]]** for legal notice.  
- The active **[[running-config]]** must be copied to **[[startup-config]]** with `copy run start` (or equivalent) to survive reloads.  
- A Layerâ€¯2 switch gains networkâ€‘wide reachability by assigning an IP address to a **[[SVI]]** (commonly VLANâ€¯1).  
- End devices receive IP settings either manually (static) or dynamically via **DHCP**; IPv6 hosts can also use SLAAC.  
- Physical connectivity options include copper Ethernet, fibreâ€‘optic links, and wireless NICs; verification tools like `ping` confirm network reachability.

# Quiz
<details><summary>1â€¯Â What is the primary difference between User EXEC mode and Privileged EXEC mode on a Cisco device?</summary>

**Answer:** Userâ€¯EXEC (`>`) offers limited monitoring commands, whereasâ€¯Privilegedâ€¯EXEC (`#`) grants full configuration and management access.  
</details>

<details><summary>2â€¯Â Explain the purpose of the <code>configure terminal</code> command.</summary>

**Answer:** It enters **Global configuration mode**, enabling changes that affect the entire device.  
</details>

<details><summary>3â€¯Â Why is SSH preferred over Telnet for remote management of network devices?</summary>

**Answer:** **[[SSH]]** encrypts all session data, protecting credentials and commands; **[[Telnet]]** transmits them in plain text.  
</details>

<details><summary>4â€¯Â Describe the function of the <code>service passwordâ€‘encryption</code> command.</summary>

**Answer:** It hashes all plainâ€‘text passwords stored in the configuration, reducing the risk of credential disclosure.  
</details>

<details><summary>5â€¯Â What is the difference between the startupâ€‘config and runningâ€‘config files?</summary>

**Answer:** `runningâ€‘config` is the live configuration in RAM; `startupâ€‘config` resides in NVRAM and loads at boot.  
</details>

<details><summary>6â€¯Â How do you save the currently active configuration on a Cisco device?</summary>

**Answer:** Issue `copy runningâ€‘config startupâ€‘config` (or `copy run start`) from Privileged EXEC mode.  
</details>

<details><summary>7â€¯Â In Windows, where do you manually configure IP settings?</summary>

**Answer:** *Control Panel â–º Network and Sharing Center â–º Change adapter settings â–º* rightâ€‘click adapter â–º *Properties â–º IPv4/IPv6 settings*.  
</details>

<details><summary>8â€¯Â What is a Switch Virtual Interface (SVI) and why configure an IP on it?</summary>

**Answer:** An **[[SVI]]** is a logical VLAN interface on a switch; assigning an IP lets administrators manage the switch over the network.  
</details>

<details><summary>9â€¯Â What is the purpose of a console cable when working with a Cisco device?</summary>

**Answer:** It provides outâ€‘ofâ€‘band access for initial setup and recovery when network links are unavailable.  
</details>

<details><summary>10â€¯Â Briefly explain the use of the <code>?</code> character in IOS.</summary>

**Answer:** It invokes contextâ€‘sensitive help, listing available commands or arguments based on cursor position.  
</details>

# Essay Questions
<details><summary>1â€¯Â Compare and contrast access methods to the IOS CLI, focusing on security and use cases.</summary>

**Answer:**  
- **Console** access is local, requires physical presence, and is indispensable for recovery but lacks encryption (although traffic never traverses the network).  
- **[[SSH]]** provides encrypted remote access, making it the deâ€‘facto choice for routine administration across insecure networks.  
- **[[Telnet]]** offers similar functionality to SSH but sends data in clear text, so it is now reserved for lab environments or legacy systems where security is not a concern.  
Appropriate use dictates console for initial provisioning or when the device is isolated, SSH for dayâ€‘toâ€‘day management, and Telnet only where risk is minimal or additional encryption (e.g., IPsec) compensates.  
</details>

<details><summary>2â€¯Â Explain IOS commandâ€‘mode hierarchy and how administrators navigate it.</summary>

**Answer:**  
IOS modes form a tree: **Userâ€¯EXEC â†’ Privilegedâ€¯EXEC â†’ Global configuration â†’ subordinate modes** (interface, line, router, etc.).  
- `enable` elevates to Privileged EXEC.  
- `configure terminal` enters Global configuration.  
- Contextâ€‘specific commands (e.g., `interface Gi0/1`) dive into subâ€‘modes.  
- `exit` retreats one level; `end`â€¯orâ€¯Ctrl+Z jumps straight to Privileged EXEC.  
This hierarchy enforces role separationâ€”monitoring, global changes, and granular tweaksâ€”while providing clear visual cues in the prompt.  
</details>

<details><summary>3â€¯Â Detail the steps for securing a new Cisco switch.</summary>

**Answer:**  
1. Assign a unique **[[Hostname]]** (`hostname swâ€‘core1`).  
2. Harden access:  
   - Console: `line con 0` â†’ `password <pw>` â†’ `login`.  
   - VTY: `line vty 0 15` â†’ `transport input ssh` â†’ `password <pw>` â†’ `login`.  
   - Encrypt privileged access with `enable secret <pw>`.  
3. Activate `service passwordâ€‘encryption`.  
4. Create an informative **[[MOTD banner]]** (`banner motd #Authorised access only#`).  
5. Configure an **SVI** IP and default gateway; enable SSH (`ip domainâ€‘name corp.local`, generate RSA keys, create user accounts).  
6. Save to `startupâ€‘config`.  
These steps thwart unauthorised logins, protect credentials at rest, and provide accountability.

<details><summary>4â€¯Â Describe configuring IP on a Windows PC and on a switch SVI, noting each parameterâ€™s role.</summary>

**Answer:**  
**PC (Windows):** In adapter properties, set:  
- **IP address** (identifies host),  
- **Subnet mask** (defines local broadcast domain),  
- **Default gateway** (router for offâ€‘subnet traffic),  
- **DNS servers** (name resolution).  

**Switch SVI:**
