# Key Concepts ðŸ”‘
- The growing number of devices exhausted the [[IPv4 Issues|IPv4]] address pool, driving adoption of [[IPv6]] and its 128â€‘bit space.  
- IPv6 addresses are written as eight hexadecimal **hexet** groups; leading zeros may be dropped and a single `::` compresses one run of zeros.  
- Address types: **Unicast** (including [[Global Unicast Address (GUA)]], [[Link-Local Address (LLA)]], [[Unique Local Address (ULA)]], and [[Anycast Address]]), **Multicast**, and *no* broadcast.  
- A GUA is structured *Global Routing Prefix*â€¯/â€¯*Subnet ID*â€¯/â€¯*InterfaceÂ ID*; /64 is the recommended prefix to support [[SLAAC]].  
- Hosts autoâ€‘configure using [[Stateless Address Autoâ€‘configuration (SLAAC)]], optionally with Statelessâ€¯/â€¯Stateful [[DHCPv6]], and verify uniqueness with [[Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)]].  
- Interface IDs are created with the **EUIâ€‘64** process or randomly for privacy.  
- IPv4 and IPv6 can coexist through **Dualâ€‘Stack**, **Tunneling**, and **Translation** (e.g. NAT64).  
- Key multicast groups include `FF02::1` (allâ€‘nodes) and `FF02::2` (allâ€‘routers); each unicast address also spawns a [[Solicited Node Multicast Address]] for efficient neighbour discovery.

# Quiz
<details>
<summary>1.Â What was the primary motivation for moving from IPv4 to IPv6?</summary>

The exhaustion of IPv4â€™s 32â€‘bit address spaceâ€”especially with IoT growthâ€”necessitated a larger pool of addresses.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>2.Â How is an IPv6 address represented, and how does this differ from IPv4?</summary>

IPv6 uses 128â€‘bit hexadecimal notation (eight 16â€‘bit hexets separated by colons) instead of IPv4â€™s 32â€‘bit dottedâ€‘decimal format.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>3.Â Explain the purpose of the double colon (::) in IPv6 addressing.</summary>

`::` compresses one consecutive sequence of zero hexets to simplify notation; it may appear only once per address to avoid ambiguity.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>4.Â What are the three main types of IPv6 addresses?</summary>

Unicast (oneâ€‘toâ€‘one), Multicast (oneâ€‘toâ€‘many), and Anycast (oneâ€‘toâ€‘nearest); IPv6 has no broadcast addresses.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>5.Â What is the recommended prefix length for IPv6 networks?</summary>

A /64 prefix, aligning with SLAACâ€™s 64â€‘bit InterfaceÂ ID expectation.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>6.Â Describe the key difference between a Global Unicast Address (GUA) and a Linkâ€‘Local Address (LLA).</summary>

A GUA is globally routable on the internet, whereas an LLA is only valid on its local link and never routed beyond it.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>7.Â What is SLAAC, and what information does a device obtain using it?</summary>

SLAAC lets a host selfâ€‘generate a GUA; it receives the network prefix, prefix length, and default gateway from Router Advertisements.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>8.Â Briefly explain the EUIâ€‘64 process for generating an InterfaceÂ ID.</summary>

The device splits its 48â€‘bit MAC, inserts `FFFE`, and flips the seventh bit to form a unique 64â€‘bit InterfaceÂ ID.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>9.Â What is a multicast address in IPv6, and can it be used as a source address?</summary>

A multicast address targets a group of receivers; it may *only* appear as a destination, never as a source address.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>10.Â How does subnetting in IPv6 differ in purpose compared to IPv4 subnetting?</summary>

IPv6 subnetting organises networks hierarchically rather than conserving addresses, thanks to the ample 128â€‘bit space.  
</details>

# Essay Questions
- Compare and contrast the addressing challenges in IPv4 that led to IPv6, citing regional exhaustion examples.  
- Explain dynamic GUA assignment methods (Router Solicitation/Advertisement vs. [[DHCPv6]] variants).  
- Discuss IPv6 unicast address types, their scope, and typical ranges.

# FAQ
> [!faq]+ **What are the main issues with IPv4 that led to the development of IPv6?**  
> IPv4â€™s 32â€‘bit space (~4â€¯billion addresses) cannot meet modern demand. NAT prolonged its life, but IoT growth exhausted the pool. IPv6â€™s 128â€‘bit space (~340â€¯undecillion) restores global addressing capacity.  

> [!faq]+ **How are IPv6 addresses represented and what are the rules for shortening them?**  
> Written as eight hexadecimal groups separated by colons; omit leading zeros in a group and compress one consecutive run of zero groups with `::`.  

> [!faq]+ **What are the main types of IPv6 addresses and how do they differ from IPv4?**  
> IPv6 uses Unicast, Multicast, and Anycast; no broadcast. Within Unicast, GUAs are internetâ€‘routable, LLAs are linkâ€‘only.  

> [!faq]+ **How is the structure of an IPv6 Global Unicast Address defined?**  
> *Global Routing Prefix* (ISPâ€‘assigned) + *SubnetÂ ID* (organisation) + *InterfaceÂ ID* (host), typically split /64â€¯+â€¯/64.  

> [!faq]+ **How can IPv6 addresses be configured on network devices?**  
> Statically via interface commands or dynamically via SLAAC, Stateless DHCPv6, or Stateful DHCPv6.  

> [!faq]+ **What is SLAAC and how does it work for dynamic IPv6 address assignment?**  
> Hosts send RS, receive RA with prefix, then generate their own InterfaceÂ ID and perform DADâ€”no state kept on router.  

> [!faq]+ **What are the different methods for a device to obtain an InterfaceÂ ID when using SLAAC?**  
> EUIâ€‘64 (MACâ€‘derived) or a randomly generated 64â€‘bit value for privacy.  

> [!faq]+ **What are IPv6 multicast addresses and what are some common examples?**  
> Prefix `FFxx::/8`; `FF02::1` allâ€‘nodes, `FF02::2` allâ€‘routers. Solicitedâ€‘node addresses map unicast/anycast addresses for neighbour discovery.

# Chapter Summary
- IPv6â€™s 128â€‘bit space eliminates address scarcity and supports future growth.  
- Hexadecimal notation with abbreviation rules (`::`, leadingâ€‘zero suppression) keeps addresses readable.  
- Address types: Unicast (GUA, LLA, ULA, Anycast), Multicast; Broadcast is obsolete.  
- Standard /64 subnets enable [[SLAAC]] and consistent InterfaceÂ ID generation (EUIâ€‘64 or random).  
- Devices autoâ€‘configure via RS/RA and optionally [[DHCPv6]]; DAD prevents duplicates.  
- IPv6 coexists with IPv4 through Dualâ€‘Stack, Tunneling, and Translation mechanisms.  
- Multicast (`FF02::1`, `FF02::2`, solicitedâ€‘node) replaces IPv4 broadcast for efficient neighbour discovery.
