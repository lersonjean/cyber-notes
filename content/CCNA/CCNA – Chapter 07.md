# Key Concepts ðŸ”‘
- [[Ethernet]] spans **Layerâ€¯1** and **[[Data Link Layer (Layerâ€¯2)]]**, whose LLC (802.2) and MAC (802.3) sublayers split protocolâ€‘ID and framing/mediaâ€‘access jobs.  
- An **Ethernet frame** = preambleâ€¯+â€¯SFD, destination/source [[MAC Address]]es, [[EtherType]], data, and [[FCS]] for error detection (64â€¯â€“â€¯1518â€¯B standard).  
- MAC addresses are 48â€¯bits: **OUI** (firstâ€¯24â€¯b) + vendor value; uniqueness is maintained by IEEE allocation.  
- Switches *learn* source MACs to populate the [[MAC Address Table (CAM Table)]]; known unicast â†’ single port, unknown/broadcast/multicast â†’ flood.  
- Forwarding styles: **[[Storeâ€‘andâ€‘Forward Switching]]** (fullâ€‘frame CRC check) vs. **[[Cutâ€‘Through Switching]]** variantsâ€”[[Fastâ€‘Forward Switching]] (lowest latency) and [[Fragmentâ€‘Free Switching]] (checks firstâ€¯64â€¯B).  
- **Fullâ€‘Duplex** links eliminate collisions; **Autoâ€‘Negotiation** sets optimal speed/duplex and prevents mismatches.  
- **Autoâ€‘MDIX** swaps TX/RX pairs automatically, so straightâ€‘through or crossover cables work interchangeably.  
- Buffering (portâ€‘based or shared memory) smooths congestion before forwarding frames.

# Quiz
<details><summary>Explain the primary function of the LLC sublayer in Ethernet frames.</summary>
The LLC sublayer identifies the Layerâ€‘3 protocol (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, ARP) encapsulated in the frame.
</details>

<details><summary>What is the purpose of the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) in an Ethernet frame?</summary>
The FCS provides CRCâ€‘based error detection so the receiver can verify frame integrity.
</details>

<details><summary>Describe the difference between a unicast and a broadcast MAC address.</summary>
Unicast targets one NIC; broadcast **FFâ€‘FFâ€‘FFâ€‘FFâ€‘FFâ€‘FF** targets all NICs on the segment.
</details>

<details><summary>How does a switch initially populate its MAC address table?</summary>
By recording the source MAC address and ingress port of each received frame (learning).
</details>

<details><summary>What happens if a switch receives a frame whose destination MAC is not in its table?</summary>
It floods the frame out all ports except the ingress port (unknown unicast flooding).
</details>

<details><summary>Explain the main difference between the Storeâ€‘andâ€‘Forward and Cutâ€‘Through switching methods.</summary>
Storeâ€‘andâ€‘Forward buffers the whole frame and checks the FCS before forwarding; Cutâ€‘Through starts forwarding after reading the destination MAC, reducing latency but risking error propagation.
</details>

<details><summary>What advantage does Fragmentâ€‘Free cutâ€‘through offer over Fastâ€‘Forward?</summary>
It checks the firstâ€¯64â€¯bytesâ€”catching most collisionâ€‘related errorsâ€”while still forwarding sooner than Storeâ€‘andâ€‘Forward.
</details>

<details><summary>Describe the function of Autoâ€‘Negotiation on an Ethernet port.</summary>
Devices automatically agree on the highest common speed and duplex, preventing manualâ€‘config mismatches.
</details>

<details><summary>What is Autoâ€‘MDIX and why is it useful?</summary>
Autoâ€‘MDIX detects cable type (straightâ€‘through vs crossover) and swaps TX/RX pairs so any cable works between any devices.
</details>

<details><summary>How does a Layerâ€‘2 switch use the MAC address table for forwarding decisions?</summary>
If the destination MAC is found, forward out the associated port; if not, flood; if broadcast/multicast, flood.
</details>

# Essay Questions
<details><summary>Compare and contrast the LLC and MAC sublayers of the Dataâ€¯Link Layer.</summary>

**LLC (IEEEâ€¯802.2)**  
*â€¯Adds multiplexing information to identify the Networkâ€‘layer protocol carried in the frame.  
*â€¯Provides service access points (SAPs) for upperâ€‘layer interaction.  
*â€¯Is protocolâ€‘independentâ€”Ethernet, Wiâ€‘Fi, and other media can share the same LLC.

**MAC (IEEEâ€¯802.3)**  
*â€¯Handles frame encapsulation/decapsulation, addressing, and media access control (CSMA/CD on legacy halfâ€‘duplex).  
*â€¯Defines physical addressing via 48â€‘bit [[MAC Address]]es.  
*â€¯Interacts directly with the Physical layer, inserting the preamble/SFD and computing the [[FCS]].

Together they deliver reliable nodeâ€‘toâ€‘node transfer: LLC tells Layerâ€‘3 who should receive the data, while MAC ensures it gets across the local medium correctly.
</details>

<details><summary>Discuss the structure of an Ethernet MAC address and how uniqueness is maintained.</summary>

A MAC address is 48â€¯bits (12 hex digits) split into:  

* **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)** â€“ firstâ€¯24â€¯bits, assigned by IEEE to each manufacturer.  
* **Vendorâ€‘Assigned Value** â€“ lastâ€¯24â€¯bits, numbered by the vendor per device/NIC.

Vendors must never reuse a value under the same OUI, and IEEE assigns each OUI only once. With 24â€¯bits of vendor space, each OUI supports 16â€¯777â€¯216 unique addresses, ensuring global uniqueness across billions of devices.
</details>

<details><summary>Explain how a Layerâ€¯2 switch learns MAC addresses and the forwarding decisions it makes.</summary>

1. **Learning** â€“ For every frame received, the switch records the **source** MAC and the ingress port in the [[MAC Address Table (CAM Table)]]. Each entry has an ageing timer (~300â€¯s).  
2. **Forwarding/Filtering** â€“ When a frame arrives:  
   * **Known unicast** â€“ destination MAC found â†’ forward only out the listed port.  
   * **Unknown unicast** â€“ not found â†’ flood out all ports except ingress.  
   * **Broadcast or multicast** â€“ flood (unless the switch performs IGMP/MLD snooping for multicast).  
3. **Updating** â€“ If a learned MAC appears on a different port, the entry is updated to reflect the new location.  
Through this dynamic process the table converges so most traffic becomes unicastâ€‘only, conserving bandwidth.

<details><summary>Analyse tradeâ€‘offs between Storeâ€‘andâ€‘Forward and Cutâ€‘Through (Fastâ€‘Forward, Fragmentâ€‘Free). When is each preferred?</summary>

| Method | Latency | Error Handling | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Storeâ€‘andâ€‘Forward** | Highest (fullâ€‘frame delay) | Checks FCS â†’ drops errored frames; supports QoS & policing | Enterprise core/edge, WAN handâ€‘off, environments needing integrity |
| **Fastâ€‘Forward** | Lowest (starts after 6â€¯bytes) | No error checking â†’ may propagate bad frames | Lowâ€‘latency clusters, HPC, cutâ€‘throughâ€‘capable DC fabrics |
| **Fragmentâ€‘Free** | Mid (after 64â€¯B) | Catches most collision/runts, avoids long CRC wait | Legacy halfâ€‘duplex nets with occasional collisions |

In modern fullâ€‘duplex networks, Storeâ€‘andâ€‘Forward dominates because latency penalties are small relative to gigabit+ speeds and error filtering/QoS inspection are valuable. Cutâ€‘Through shines in specialist, errorâ€‘controlled environments where microseconds matter.
</details>

<details><summary>Describe duplexing and autoâ€‘negotiation. How can duplex mismatch occur and what are its effects?</summary>

* **Halfâ€‘Duplex** â€“ send *or* receive at a time; relies on CSMA/CD to detect collisions on shared media.  
* **Fullâ€‘Duplex** â€“ simultaneous sendâ€¯+â€¯receive; each port is its own collision domain, so CSMA/CD is disabled.

**Autoâ€‘Negotiation (IEEEâ€¯802.3u/ab)** exchanges Fast Link Pulses to settle on the best common speed/duplex.  

**Duplex Mismatch** happens when one end is manually set (e.g., 100â€¯Full) and the other end is autonegotiating or hardâ€‘set differently (e.g., 100â€¯Half). Symptoms: high FCS/lateâ€‘collision counts, severe throughput collapse, and erratic connectivity. Always configure both ends to Auto or both to identical manual settings to avoid the problem.
