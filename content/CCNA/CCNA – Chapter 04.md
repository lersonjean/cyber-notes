# Key Concepts ðŸ”‘
- The [[Physical Layer]] (Layerâ€¯1) provides the essential wired or wireless link that underpins all network communication.  
- It converts complete frames from the Data Link layer into a serial bitâ€‘stream and encodes them as electrical, optical, or radio signals.  
- Standards bodies (IEEE, TIA/EIA, ITU, ISO) define Layerâ€¯1 [[encoding]], [[signaling]], connectors, and testing to guarantee interoperability.  
- Network performance at this layer is described by [[Bandwidth]], [[Latency]], [[Throughput]], and [[Goodput]].  
- Copper mediaâ€”[[UTP]], [[STP]], and [[Coaxial Cable]]â€”is inexpensive but limited to â‰ˆ100â€¯m and vulnerable to [[Attenuation]], EMI/RFI, and [[Crosstalk]].  
- [[Fiber Optic Cable]] ([[Singleâ€‘mode Fiber (SMF)]] / [[Multimode Fiber (MMF)]]) carries light pulses for very high bandwidth over long distances and is immune to electrical noise.  
- Wireless media (IEEEâ€¯802.11/15/16) offers mobility via a [[Wireless Access Point (AP or WAP)]], but bandwidth is shared, halfâ€‘duplex, and interferenceâ€‘prone.  
- Proper cable selectionâ€”[[Straight-through Cable]], [[Crossover Cable]], [[Rollover Cable]]â€”plus Autoâ€‘MDIX ensures correct pinouts between devices.

# Quiz
<details>
<summary>1. What is the primary purpose of the physical layer in network communication?</summary>

**Answer:** The [[Physical Layer]]'s main purpose is to establish the physical connection between devices and transmit raw bits over the network medium. It takes data from the upper layers and encodes it into signals appropriate for the chosen media.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. What are the three main types of physical media discussed in the source material?</summary>

**Answer:** Copper cabling, fiberâ€‘optic cabling, and wireless media.

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. What is the role of a Network Interface Card (NIC) at the physical layer?</summary>

**Answer:** A [[Network Interface Card (NIC)]] provides the hardware interface that connects a device to the network medium (wired, wireless, or cellular).

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Explain the difference between encoding and signaling at the physical layer.</summary>

**Answer:** **Encoding** converts a stream of bits into a recognisable format (patterns). **Signaling** defines how those encoded bits are represented on the medium itselfâ€”e.g., voltages on copper or light pulses in fiber.

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Define bandwidth and explain how it is typically measured.</summary>

**Answer:** [[Bandwidth]] is the maximum capacity of a medium to carry data, measured in bits per second (bps), kilobitsâ€¯/s (Kbps), megabitsâ€¯/s (Mbps), etc.

</details>

<details>
<summary>6. What is attenuation, and what type of physical media is particularly susceptible to it?</summary>

**Answer:** [[Attenuation]] is signal weakening over distance; copper cabling is especially susceptible.

</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Describe two types of noise that can affect copper cabling.</summary>

**Answer:** [[Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)]] (electrical noise) and [[Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)]] (radioâ€‘wave noise).

</details>

<details>
<summary>8. What is crosstalk, and how is it mitigated in twistedâ€‘pair copper cables?</summary>

**Answer:** [[Crosstalk]] is interference between adjacent wires. Twisting the pairs at differing rates cancels much of the interference.

</details>

<details>
<summary>9. What is the primary difference between singleâ€‘mode fiber (SMF) and multimode fiber (MMF)?</summary>

**Answer:** [[Singleâ€‘mode Fiber (SMF)]] has a smaller core, uses a laser, and supports very long distances; [[Multimode Fiber (MMF)]] has a larger core, uses an LED, and is suited for shorter distances.

</details>

<details>
<summary>10. Identify two limitations of wireless media compared to wired connections.</summary>

**Answer:** Limited coverage area (environmental factors) and susceptibility to interference; additionally, wireless bandwidth is shared and operates halfâ€‘duplex.

</details>

# Essay Questions
<details>
<summary>1. Compare and contrast copper, fiberâ€‘optic, and wireless media in terms of bandwidth capabilities, transmission distance, cost, and susceptibility to interference. Discuss typical applications for each type.</summary>

**Answer:**  
- **Copper (UTP/STP/Coax):** Up to 10â€¯Gbps (Catâ€¯6A), limited to ~100â€¯m, low cost, susceptible to EMI/RFI and [[Crosstalk]]. Typical for LAN drops, patch panels, and shortâ€‘run interconnects.  
- **Fiberâ€‘optic:** 10â€¯Gbpsâ€“400â€¯Gbps+, distances of kilometres (SMF) or hundreds of metres (MMF), higher cost, immune to electrical interference. Used for dataâ€‘center backbones, longâ€‘haul links, FTTH, and ISP peering.  
- **Wireless:** 600â€¯Mbpsâ€“10â€¯Gbps (Wiâ€‘Fiâ€¯6/7 theoretical), distances vary (tens of metres indoors), low to moderate infrastructure cost but shared bandwidth, prone to interference and security risks. Ideal for mobility in homes, campuses, and IoT.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Explain the role of standards organisations such as IEEE, EIA, and ITU in the physical layer of networking. Provide specific examples of how these standards influence the design and implementation of network infrastructure.</summary>

**Answer:**  
- **IEEE** defines Ethernet and Wiâ€‘Fi physical standards (e.g., IEEEâ€¯802.3 10GBASEâ€‘T copper, 802.11ax Wiâ€‘Fiâ€¯6).  
- **EIA/TIA** publishes cabling and connector standards (TIA/EIAâ€‘568 wiring pinouts, TIAâ€‘568â€‘C Catâ€¯6 performance specs).  
- **ITU** sets international telecom specs (e.g., ITUâ€‘T G.652 fiber characteristics).  
These bodies ensure that cables, connectors, and transceivers from different vendors interoperate, guarantee minimum performance, and enable widespread adoption.

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Detail the process of encapsulation and deâ€‘encapsulation as it relates to the physical layer.</summary>

**Answer:**  
At transmission, the application payload is successively wrapped in a segment (Transport), packet (Network), and frame (Data Link). The [[Physical Layer]] encodes that frame into bits and transmits signals over the medium. At the receiver, the reverse (deâ€‘encapsulation) occurs: signals â†’ bits â†’ frame â†’ packet â†’ segment â†’ data.

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Discuss the different types of copper cabling, including UTP, STP, and coaxial cable. Explain the construction of each type and how features like twisting and shielding mitigate issues such as attenuation and interference.</summary>

**Answer:**  
- **UTP:** Four twisted pairs, no shielding; twisting combats [[Crosstalk]].  
- **STP:** Same pair structure plus foil/braided shielding around pairs or bundle; shielding blocks EMI/RFI.  
- **Coaxial Cable:** Central conductor, dielectric, braided shield, outer jacket; concentric design provides excellent EMI immunity. Shielding and controlled impedance reduce attenuation and external noise.

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Describe the different cabling standards and connectors used for copper (e.g., T568A/B, RJâ€‘45) and fiberâ€‘optic cables (e.g., ST, SC, LC). Explain the purpose of straightâ€‘through, crossover, and rollover cables for copper connections.</summary>

**Answer:**  
Copper uses RJâ€‘45 connectors with T568A or T568B pinouts. **Straightâ€‘through** cables (same pinout both ends) link unlike devices; **Crossover** (Aâ†”B) link like devices; **Rollover** (console) connects a PC serial port to a router switch. Fiber connectors include **ST** (bayonet), **SC** (pushâ€‘pull square), and **LC** (small formâ€‘factor; duplex pair).
