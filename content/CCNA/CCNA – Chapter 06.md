# Key Concepts ðŸ”‘
- The <strong>Data Link Layer</strong> (LayerÂ 2) provides local communication between device <strong>NIC</strong>s and prepares <strong>Layer 3</strong> packets for transmission on the physical medium.  
- Two subâ€‘layers divide LayerÂ 2: <strong>LL</strong> (interface to upper layers) and <strong>MAC (Media Access Control)|MAC</strong> (framing and media access).  
- Routers decapsulate incoming frames, examine the packet, and reâ€‘encapsulate it with new <strong>MAC Address</strong>es at every hop.  
- Network topologies have physical and logical views; common WAN topologies are <strong>Point-to-Point</strong>, <strong>Hub and Spoke</strong>, and <strong>Mesh Topology</strong>. The prevalent LAN topology is the <strong>Star Topology</strong>.  
- Links operate halfâ€‘duplex or fullâ€‘duplex; duplex mode dictates simultaneous transmission capability.  
- Sharedâ€‘media access is controlled by contention methods (<strong>CSMA/CD</strong>, <strong>CSMA/CA</strong>) or deterministic controlled access.  
- A data <strong>Frame</strong> consists of header, payload (LayerÂ 3 packet) and trailer; the trailer carries <strong>Error Detection</strong> data.  
- <strong>MAC Address|LayerÂ 2 addressing</strong> is for local delivery only and is rewritten at each hop.  
- IEEE, ISO, ITU, and ANSI define and maintain LayerÂ 2 standards.

# Quiz
<details>
<summary>1. What is the primary responsibility of the Data Link Layer (LayerÂ 2)?</summary>

The Data Link Layer enables communication between device <strong>NIC</strong>s and provides upperâ€‘layer protocols with access to the physical media by framing packets for transmission.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. What are the two main subâ€‘layers of the Data Link Layer and their functions?</summary>

- **<strong>LLC</strong>** â€“ interfaces with upperâ€‘layer protocols and manages error handling and flow control.  
- **<strong>MAC (Media Access Control)|MAC</strong>** â€“ encapsulates data into frames, applies addressing, and controls access to the medium.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Explain the difference between a physical topology and a logical topology.</summary>

A **physical topology** depicts the tangible layout of devices and cabling, while a **logical topology** shows virtual paths based on addressing and interface usage (e.g., VLANs, IP subnets).
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Name three common WAN topologies.</summary>

<strong>Point-to-Point</strong>, <strong>Hub and Spoke</strong>, and <strong>Mesh Topology</strong>.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Describe the difference between halfâ€‘duplex and fullâ€‘duplex communication.</summary>

**Halfâ€‘duplex** allows only one device to transmit at a time; **fullâ€‘duplex** allows simultaneous send and receive.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. What are CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA, and where are they typically used?</summary>

- **<strong>CSMA/CD</strong>** â€“ collision detection used on busâ€‘topology Ethernet.  
- **<strong>CSMA/CA</strong>** â€“ collision avoidance used on WLANs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. What happens to a data frame at each hop between LayerÂ 3 devices?</summary>

Each router decapsulates the frame, examines the packet, encapsulates it in a new frame with updated <strong>MAC Address</strong>es, and forwards it to the next segment.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. What information is typically included in the header of a data link frame?</summary>

Start/end delimiters, source and destination <strong>MAC Address</strong>es, a type field identifying the LayerÂ 3 protocol, and flowâ€‘control information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. What is the purpose of the trailer in a data link frame?</summary>

The trailer includes errorâ€‘detection data (e.g., FCS) and marks the end of the frame.
</details>

<details>
<summary>10. Are LayerÂ 2 addresses used for endâ€‘toâ€‘end communication across networks? Explain.</summary>

No. <strong>MAC Address|LayerÂ 2 addresses</strong> are only for local delivery within a segment and are rewritten at each hop; endâ€‘toâ€‘end delivery relies on <strong>Layer 3</strong> addressing.
</details>

# Essay Questions
<details>
<summary>Discuss the relationship between the Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC) subâ€‘layers of the Data Link Layer and explain how they work together to facilitate network communication.</summary>

> [!info] **Answer**  
> The <strong>LLC</strong> and <strong>MAC (Media Access Control)|MAC</strong> subâ€‘layers form a service pair that collectively fulfils all LayerÂ 2 responsibilities:  
> â€¢ **LLC (IEEEÂ 802.2)** provides a consistent interface to the network layer, identifies upperâ€‘layer protocols using Service Access Points (SAPs), and can add optional error checking and flowâ€‘control features.  
> â€¢ **MAC (IEEEÂ 802.x variants)** handles the mechanics of media accessâ€”framing, addressing, start/stop delimiters, <strong>Error Detection</strong> (FCS), and timing.  
> LLC delegates frame construction and medium arbitration to MAC, while MAC relies on LLC for protocol multiplexing and (when enabled) flow control. Together they present a transparent, reliable link service to <strong>Layer 3</strong> regardless of the physical medium.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Compare and contrast the operation of Carrier Sensing Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) and Carrier Sensing Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), highlighting the scenarios where each is typically employed.</summary>

> [!info] **Answer**  
> â€¢ **<strong>CSMA/CD</strong>** (wired Ethernet): devices listen for an idle line, transmit, and monitor the medium for collisions; on detection they send jam signals and back off for a random interval. It assumes halfâ€‘duplex shared copper where collisions can be detected electrically.  
> â€¢ **<strong>CSMA/CA</strong>** (WLAN 802.11): devices sense the channel, use random backâ€‘off timers, and optionally exchange RTS/CTS control frames to reserve airtime before transmitting. Wireless nodes cannot reliably detect collisions in progress, so they avoid them instead.  
> â€¢ **When to use**: CSMA/CD is legacyâ€”modern switched Ethernet eliminates collisions. CSMA/CA remains essential in Wiâ€‘Fi where halfâ€‘duplex, shared-radio conditions persist and collision detection is impractical.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the process of frame encapsulation and decapsulation as a data frame traverses a network path involving multiple LayerÂ 3 devices.</summary>

> [!info] **Answer**  
> 1. **At the sender**: The network layer hands a packet to LLC, which adds its header (SAP). MAC then adds a MAC header (source/destination <strong>MAC Address</strong>es, type) and trailer (FCS), forming a <strong>Data Frame</strong>.  
> 2. **Across the first link**: The frame is transmitted to the first router.  
> 3. **At each router hop**: The routerâ€™s NIC checks the FCS, passes the frame to MAC, which strips the header/trailer (decapsulation). LLC passes the intact packet to the routerâ€™s network layer for forwarding. The router then creates a new frame appropriate to the outgoing interface: MAC adds new source/destination addresses and FCS (encapsulation).  
> 4. **Process repeats** until the frame reaches the destination LAN.  
> 5. **At the destination host**: After FCS validation, MAC and LLC remove their headers/trailers and deliver the packet to the network layer.  
> This hopâ€‘byâ€‘hop refresh ensures local addressing and mediaâ€‘specific framing while preserving the original endâ€‘toâ€‘end LayerÂ 3 information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Analyze the importance of both physical and logical network topologies in understanding and designing network infrastructure. Provide examples of common physical and logical topologies and their characteristics.</summary>

> [!info] **Answer**  
> â€¢ **Physical topology** concerns cable layout and device placementâ€”critical for distance limits, fault domains, and installation cost. Examples:  
>   â€“ **<strong>Star Topology</strong>** (switchâ€‘centric LAN): easy troubleshooting, scalable, singleâ€‘point failure at the switch mitigated by redundancy.  
>   â€“ **<strong>Hub and Spoke</strong>** WAN: economical but hub congestion risk.  
> â€¢ **Logical topology** reflects dataâ€‘flow paths, addressing, and segmentationâ€”vital for security, broadcast containment, and routing efficiency. Examples:  
>   â€“ **VLANâ€‘based logical star** over a physical star switch fabric.  
>   â€“ **<strong>Mesh Topology</strong>** routing overlays in VPNs or SDâ€‘WAN that provide multiple logical paths across a partially meshed physical network.  
> Designers must align physical constraints (media type, distance) with logical requirements (traffic patterns, redundancy) for an optimal solution.

<details>
<summary>Describe the key fields found within a data link frame and explain the purpose of each field in enabling the successful transmission and reception of data.</summary>

> [!info] **Answer**  
> Typical Ethernet frame fields:  
> â€¢ **Preamble & SFD** â€“ synchronize clocks and mark frame start.  
> â€¢ **Destination <strong>MAC Address</strong> / Source MAC Address** â€“ identify receiving and sending NICs on the local segment.  
> â€¢ **Type/Length** â€“ indicates encapsulated LayerÂ 3 protocol (e.g., 0x0800 for IPv4) or payload size.  
> â€¢ **Payload (Data)** â€“ carries the upperâ€‘layer packet.  
> â€¢ **FCS** â€“ 32â€‘bit CRC in the <strong>Trailer</strong> that enables <strong>Error Detection</strong>; receivers discard frames with mismatched CRCs.  
> Together these fields delimit, address, classify, and verify each frame, ensuring reliable data delivery over the shared medium.
