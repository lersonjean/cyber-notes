# Key Concepts ðŸ”‘
- The [[Data Link Layer]] (LayerÂ 2) provides local communication between device [[NIC]]s and prepares [[Layer 3]] packets for transmission on the physical medium.  
- Two subâ€‘layers divide LayerÂ 2: [[LL]] (interface to upper layers) and [[MAC (Media Access Control)|MAC]] (framing and media access).  
- Routers decapsulate incoming frames, examine the packet, and reâ€‘encapsulate it with new [[MAC Address]]es at every hop.  
- Network topologies have physical and logical views; common WAN topologies are [[Point-to-Point]], [[Hub and Spoke]], and [[Mesh Topology]]. The prevalent LAN topology is the [[Star Topology]].  
- Links operate halfâ€‘duplex or fullâ€‘duplex; duplex mode dictates simultaneous transmission capability.  
- Sharedâ€‘media access is controlled by contention methods ([[CSMA/CD]], [[CSMA/CA]]) or deterministic controlled access.  
- A data [[Frame]] consists of header, payload (LayerÂ 3 packet) and trailer; the trailer carries [[Error Detection]] data.  
- [[MAC Address|LayerÂ 2 addressing]] is for local delivery only and is rewritten at each hop.  
- IEEE, ISO, ITU, and ANSI define and maintain LayerÂ 2 standards.

# Quiz
<details>
<summary>1. What is the primary responsibility of the Data Link Layer (LayerÂ 2)?</summary>

The Data Link Layer enables communication between device [[NIC]]s and provides upperâ€‘layer protocols with access to the physical media by framing packets for transmission.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. What are the two main subâ€‘layers of the Data Link Layer and their functions?</summary>

- **[[LLC]]** â€“ interfaces with upperâ€‘layer protocols and manages error handling and flow control.  
- **[[MAC (Media Access Control)|MAC]]** â€“ encapsulates data into frames, applies addressing, and controls access to the medium.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Explain the difference between a physical topology and a logical topology.</summary>

A **physical topology** depicts the tangible layout of devices and cabling, while a **logical topology** shows virtual paths based on addressing and interface usage (e.g., VLANs, IP subnets).
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Name three common WAN topologies.</summary>

[[Point-to-Point]], [[Hub and Spoke]], and [[Mesh Topology]].
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Describe the difference between halfâ€‘duplex and fullâ€‘duplex communication.</summary>

**Halfâ€‘duplex** allows only one device to transmit at a time; **fullâ€‘duplex** allows simultaneous send and receive.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. What are CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA, and where are they typically used?</summary>

- **[[CSMA/CD]]** â€“ collision detection used on busâ€‘topology Ethernet.  
- **[[CSMA/CA]]** â€“ collision avoidance used on WLANs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. What happens to a data frame at each hop between LayerÂ 3 devices?</summary>

Each router decapsulates the frame, examines the packet, encapsulates it in a new frame with updated [[MAC Address]]es, and forwards it to the next segment.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. What information is typically included in the header of a data link frame?</summary>

Start/end delimiters, source and destination [[MAC Address]]es, a type field identifying the LayerÂ 3 protocol, and flowâ€‘control information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. What is the purpose of the trailer in a data link frame?</summary>

The trailer includes errorâ€‘detection data (e.g., FCS) and marks the end of the frame.
</details>

<details>
<summary>10. Are LayerÂ 2 addresses used for endâ€‘toâ€‘end communication across networks? Explain.</summary>

No. [[MAC Address|LayerÂ 2 addresses]] are only for local delivery within a segment and are rewritten at each hop; endâ€‘toâ€‘end delivery relies on [[Layer 3]] addressing.
</details>

# Essay Questions
<details>
<summary>Discuss the relationship between the Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC) subâ€‘layers of the Data Link Layer and explain how they work together to facilitate network communication.</summary>

> [!info] **Answer**  
> The [[LLC]] and [[MAC (Media Access Control)|MAC]] subâ€‘layers form a service pair that collectively fulfils all LayerÂ 2 responsibilities:  
> â€¢ **LLC (IEEEÂ 802.2)** provides a consistent interface to the network layer, identifies upperâ€‘layer protocols using Service Access Points (SAPs), and can add optional error checking and flowâ€‘control features.  
> â€¢ **MAC (IEEEÂ 802.x variants)** handles the mechanics of media accessâ€”framing, addressing, start/stop delimiters, [[Error Detection]] (FCS), and timing.  
> LLC delegates frame construction and medium arbitration to MAC, while MAC relies on LLC for protocol multiplexing and (when enabled) flow control. Together they present a transparent, reliable link service to [[Layer 3]] regardless of the physical medium.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Compare and contrast the operation of Carrier Sensing Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) and Carrier Sensing Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), highlighting the scenarios where each is typically employed.</summary>

> [!info] **Answer**  
> â€¢ **[[CSMA/CD]]** (wired Ethernet): devices listen for an idle line, transmit, and monitor the medium for collisions; on detection they send jam signals and back off for a random interval. It assumes halfâ€‘duplex shared copper where collisions can be detected electrically.  
> â€¢ **[[CSMA/CA]]** (WLAN 802.11): devices sense the channel, use random backâ€‘off timers, and optionally exchange RTS/CTS control frames to reserve airtime before transmitting. Wireless nodes cannot reliably detect collisions in progress, so they avoid them instead.  
> â€¢ **When to use**: CSMA/CD is legacyâ€”modern switched Ethernet eliminates collisions. CSMA/CA remains essential in Wiâ€‘Fi where halfâ€‘duplex, shared-radio conditions persist and collision detection is impractical.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the process of frame encapsulation and decapsulation as a data frame traverses a network path involving multiple LayerÂ 3 devices.</summary>

> [!info] **Answer**  
> 1. **At the sender**: The network layer hands a packet to LLC, which adds its header (SAP). MAC then adds a MAC header (source/destination [[MAC Address]]es, type) and trailer (FCS), forming a [[Data Frame]].  
> 2. **Across the first link**: The frame is transmitted to the first router.  
> 3. **At each router hop**: The routerâ€™s NIC checks the FCS, passes the frame to MAC, which strips the header/trailer (decapsulation). LLC passes the intact packet to the routerâ€™s network layer for forwarding. The router then creates a new frame appropriate to the outgoing interface: MAC adds new source/destination addresses and FCS (encapsulation).  
> 4. **Process repeats** until the frame reaches the destination LAN.  
> 5. **At the destination host**: After FCS validation, MAC and LLC remove their headers/trailers and deliver the packet to the network layer.  
> This hopâ€‘byâ€‘hop refresh ensures local addressing and mediaâ€‘specific framing while preserving the original endâ€‘toâ€‘end LayerÂ 3 information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Analyze the importance of both physical and logical network topologies in understanding and designing network infrastructure. Provide examples of common physical and logical topologies and their characteristics.</summary>

> [!info] **Answer**  
> â€¢ **Physical topology** concerns cable layout and device placementâ€”critical for distance limits, fault domains, and installation cost. Examples:  
>   â€“ **[[Star Topology]]** (switchâ€‘centric LAN): easy troubleshooting, scalable, singleâ€‘point failure at the switch mitigated by redundancy.  
>   â€“ **[[Hub and Spoke]]** WAN: economical but hub congestion risk.  
> â€¢ **Logical topology** reflects dataâ€‘flow paths, addressing, and segmentationâ€”vital for security, broadcast containment, and routing efficiency. Examples:  
>   â€“ **VLANâ€‘based logical star** over a physical star switch fabric.  
>   â€“ **[[Mesh Topology]]** routing overlays in VPNs or SDâ€‘WAN that provide multiple logical paths across a partially meshed physical network.  
> Designers must align physical constraints (media type, distance) with logical requirements (traffic patterns, redundancy) for an optimal solution.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the key fields found within a data link frame and explain the purpose of each field in enabling the successful transmission and reception of data.</summary>

> [!info] **Answer**  
> Typical Ethernet frame fields:  
> â€¢ **Preamble & SFD** â€“ synchronize clocks and mark frame start.  
> â€¢ **Destination [[MAC Address]] / Source MAC Address** â€“ identify receiving and sending NICs on the local segment.  
> â€¢ **Type/Length** â€“ indicates encapsulated LayerÂ 3 protocol (e.g., 0x0800 for IPv4) or payload size.  
> â€¢ **Payload (Data)** â€“ carries the upperâ€‘layer packet.  
> â€¢ **FCS** â€“ 32â€‘bit CRC in the [[Trailer]] that enables [[Error Detection]]; receivers discard frames with mismatched CRCs.  
> Together these fields delimit, address, classify, and verify each frame, ensuring reliable data delivery over the shared medium.
