# Quiz
<details>
<summary>What are three common types of security vulnerabilities identified in the source material?</summary>
Technology vulnerabilities (protocol/OS/equipment flaws), configuration vulnerabilities (default settings/weak passwords/misconfigurations), policy-related vulnerabilities (lack of policies/weak authentication).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the main difference between a virus and a worm.</summary>
A <strong>Virus</strong> inserts into programs and needs user action to spread; a <strong>Worm</strong> is self-replicating and spreads without human interaction.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Trojan horse in the context of malware?</summary>
A <strong>Trojan Horse</strong> is malware disguised as legitimate software that opens a backdoor when executed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what a reconnaissance attack aims to achieve.</summary>
Gather information about a target network‚ÄîIP addresses, services, vulnerabilities‚Äîusing scanners or lookup tools.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the primary objective of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack?</summary>
Overwhelm a system or service‚Äôs resources to make it unavailable to legitimate users.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is "defense-in-depth" and why is it important for network security?</summary>
Layered security combining multiple controls so if one layer fails, others still protect the network.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Briefly explain the three components of AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting).</summary>
**Authentication**: verifies identity. **Authorization**: determines permissions. **Accounting**: tracks user activity.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the purpose of a Demilitarised Zone (DMZ)?</summary>
A buffer segment between internal/external networks hosting public servers to protect the internal network.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Name two types of firewall filtering mentioned in the source.</summary>
Packet filtering and Stateful Packet Inspection (also application filtering, URL filtering).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is disabling unused services on a network device a good security practice?</summary>
Reduces attack surface by eliminating unnecessary potential entry points.
</details>

# Essay Questions
<details>
<summary>Discuss the relationship between administrative policies, configuration vulnerabilities, and the overall security posture of a network. How can a lack of clear administrative policies exacerbate configuration vulnerabilities?</summary>
*Full answer:*  
Administrative policies define standards and procedures. Without clear policies, administrators may leave default settings, weak passwords, or misconfigurations in place, increasing configuration vulnerabilities. This weakens the overall security posture because technical controls rely on proper configuration and consistent enforcement.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Compare and contrast different types of malware, specifically viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, explaining their propagation methods and potential impact on a system.</summary>
*Full answer:*  
Viruses attach to host programs and need user action to spread, often corrupting files. Worms self-replicate across networks, consuming bandwidth and resources. Trojan horses masquerade as benign software but open backdoors for attackers. Each impacts systems differently: viruses corrupt data, worms disrupt service, and Trojans enable unauthorized access.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the concept of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, including the roles of the threat actor, zombies, and the botnet. Discuss the challenges associated with mitigating DDoS attacks.</summary>
*Full answer:*  
A DDoS attack uses a botnet‚Äîa network of compromised ‚Äúzombie‚Äù hosts‚Äîcontrolled by a threat actor to flood a target. The volume and distribution make detection and filtering difficult. Mitigation challenges include distinguishing legitimate traffic from attack traffic, resource cost of filtering, and botnet scale.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the different types of access attacks mentioned in the source, such as password attacks, trust exploitation, port redirection, and man-in-the-middle attacks. For each type, briefly explain how an attacker exploits the vulnerability.</summary>
*Full answer:*  
Password attacks: brute-force or sniffing credentials. Trust exploitation: abusing legitimate trust relationships between systems. Port redirection: forwarding traffic to a malicious host. Man-in-the-middle: intercepting and altering communications between parties.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Analyze the importance of device-hardening techniques, including disabling unused services, configuring strong passwords with extra protections, and enabling SSH for remote access. How do these techniques contribute to a defense-in-depth strategy?</summary>
*Full answer:*  
Device hardening reduces potential vulnerabilities at the network edge. Disabling services lowers attack surface. Strong passwords with min-length, encryption, login block-for, and exec-timeout prevent unauthorized access. Enabling SSH ensures encrypted management sessions. Together, these add layers within the defense-in-depth framework.

# FAQ
> [!info] **What are the common types of security threats and vulnerabilities in a network?**  
> Threats stem from ‚Äúthreat actors‚Äù exploiting weaknesses in software, hardware, or credentials. Vulnerabilities are **technological**, **configuration**, and **policy-related**, plus **physical** (hardware damage, environmental, electrical, maintenance).

> [!info] **What are the primary categories of network attacks?**  
> **Malware** (viruses, worms, Trojans), **Reconnaissance** (information gathering), **Access attacks** (password, trust, port redirection, man-in-the-middle), **DoS/DDoS** (resource exhaustion).

> [!info] **How can organizations mitigate network attacks?**  
> Use **Defense-in-Depth**: firewalls, VPNs, IPS, ESA/WSA, AAA servers; maintain regular **backups**; enforce **patch management**; secure endpoints with policies, antivirus, NAC.

> [!info] **What is AAA and how does it contribute to network security?**  
> AAA controls access via **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Accounting**, providing identity verification, permission control, and activity trails for auditing.

> [!info] **What are firewalls and what are their different types?**  
> Firewalls filter traffic based on rules. Types: **Packet filtering**, **Application filtering**, **URL filtering**, **Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI)**. Use a **DMZ** for public servers.

> [!info] **Why is device security important and what are some key device-hardening techniques?**  
> Hardening secures routers/switches against attacks: change defaults, remove unused services, apply patches, use Cisco AutoSecure, enforce strong passwords.

> [!info] **What are the best practices for creating and managing passwords for network security?**  
> Use complex passwords ‚â•8‚Äì10 characters (mixed case, numbers, symbols) or passphrases; change regularly; avoid writing them down; enable encryption (`service password-encryption`), `security password min-length`, `login block-for`, `exec-timeout`.

> [!info] **How can SSH be configured and why is it preferred over Telnet for secure remote access?**  
> SSH encrypts all traffic; configuration steps: set `hostname`, `ip domain-name`, generate RSA keys, create user (`login local`), enable SSH on interfaces (`transport input ssh`), disable Telnet.
