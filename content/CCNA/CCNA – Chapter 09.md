# Key Concepts üîë
- <strong>MAC Address</strong> (Layer‚ÄØ2) delivers Ethernet frames locally, while the unchanging <strong>IP Address</strong> (Layer‚ÄØ3) routes packets end‚Äëto‚Äëend.  
- <strong>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</strong> maps IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses through broadcast <strong>ARP Request</strong>s and unicast <strong>ARP Reply</strong>s.  
- Devices store learned mappings in an <strong>ARP Table</strong> that ages out automatically.  
- IPv6 replaces ARP with <strong>Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)</strong>, using ICMPv6 <strong>Neighbor Solicitation (NS)</strong> and <strong>Neighbor Advertisement (NA)</strong> messages for address resolution.  
- <strong>Router Solicitation (RS)</strong> and <strong>Router Advertisement (RA)</strong> messages enable hosts to discover gateways, prefixes and perform <strong>SLAAC</strong>.  
- Excessive ARP broadcasts waste bandwidth and open the door to <strong>ARP Poisoning</strong>; enterprise switches offer mitigation features.  
- For off‚Äëlink traffic, frames use the MAC address of the <strong>Default Gateway</strong> interface‚Äînot the remote host‚Äôs MAC.

# Quiz
1. **Explain the primary difference in the function of a MAC address and an IP address.**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>
   A MAC address delivers frames between devices on the same LAN (Layer¬†2); an IP address identifies hosts end‚Äëto‚Äëend across networks (Layer¬†3).  
   </details>

2. **Where is a MAC address used for frame delivery?**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>
   Between NICs on the same local network segment (broadcast domain).  
   </details>

3. **What information does the IP address contain that allows for end‚Äëto‚Äëend communication?**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>
   Source and destination logical addresses that stay constant across every hop, enabling routing through multiple networks.  
   </details>

4. **When sending a frame to a device on a different network, what destination MAC address is used?**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>
   The MAC address of the host‚Äôs default‚Äëgateway interface.  
   </details>

5. **What is the main purpose of ARP in IPv4?**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>
   To resolve an IPv4 address to its corresponding MAC address on the local network.  
   </details>

6. **How does a device obtain a MAC address that is not in its ARP table?**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>
   It broadcasts an ARP Request; the target host replies with its MAC in an ARP Reply.  
   </details>

7. **What is an ARP table used for?**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>
   Caches IPv4‚Äëto‚ÄëMAC mappings so the host can avoid unnecessary broadcasts.  
   </details>

8. **Name one potential issue associated with ARP broadcasts.**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>
   Excessive broadcasts consume bandwidth and can slow large networks, or forged replies can enable ARP poisoning attacks.  
   </details>

9. **What protocol does IPv6 use instead of ARP for address resolution?**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>
   <strong>Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)</strong>.  
   </details>

10. **Briefly describe the roles of Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages.**  
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>
    An NS requests the MAC address for a known IPv6 address (or tests uniqueness); the target responds with an NA containing its MAC.  
    </details>

# Essay Questions
- Compare and contrast <strong>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</strong> in IPv4 and <strong>Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)</strong> in IPv6, noting similarities and differences.  
- Explain how a host forwards a packet to a remote network, emphasising address resolution for the <strong>Default Gateway</strong>.  
- Discuss security vulnerabilities of ARP and outline mitigation techniques (e.g., dynamic ARP inspection).  
- Detail ICMPv6 message types used by NDP and the role each plays in IPv6 networking.  
- Describe why maintaining an <strong>ARP Table</strong> or IPv6 Neighbor Cache is important, including entry ageing and manual management.

# FAQ
> [!faq]- **Fundamental differences between MAC and IP addresses**  
> MAC addresses work at Layer‚ÄØ2 for local delivery; IP addresses work at Layer‚ÄØ3 for end‚Äëto‚Äëend routing. Frames use MACs, packets use IPs.

> [!faq]- **How does ARP function in IPv4?**  
> The host checks its <strong>ARP Table</strong>; if no mapping exists it broadcasts an <strong>ARP Request</strong>. The target replies with an <strong>ARP Reply</strong> containing its MAC.

> [!faq]- **Two primary functions of ARP**  
> 1) Resolve IPv4‚Äëto‚ÄëMAC mappings. 2) Build and maintain the ARP cache for efficiency.

# Chapter Summary
- <strong>MAC Address</strong>es are rewritten each hop; <strong>IP Address</strong>es remain constant for end‚Äëto‚Äëend delivery.  
- <strong>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</strong> resolves IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses and caches the result in an <strong>ARP Table</strong>.  
- Excessive ARP broadcasts strain large LANs, and spoofed replies enable <strong>ARP Poisoning</strong>.  
- IPv6 eliminates ARP, using <strong>Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)</strong> with ICMPv6 NS/NA messages for address resolution.  
- <strong>Router Solicitation (RS)</strong>/<strong>Router Advertisement (RA)</strong> messages supply prefixes, gateways and enable <strong>SLAAC</strong>.  
- For off‚Äëlink traffic a host sends the frame to its <strong>Default Gateway</strong>‚Äôs MAC, not the remote host‚Äôs MAC.  
- ARP and NDP caches age out entries automatically; manual management aids troubleshooting.  
- Understanding address‚Äëresolution flow is essential for diagnosing connectivity issues at Layer‚ÄØ2/3.
