# Key Concepts üîë
- Cost is the primary design driver for small/medium business networks.  
- Device selection must weigh port/interface speed, features, and long-term [[Scalability]].  
- [[Redundancy]] increases reliability but is often limited by budget‚Äîidentify and protect single points of failure.  
- Plan IP addressing for every host, server, peripheral, and intermediary device before deployment.  
- Real-time traffic (voice, video) needs [[QoS]] so high-priority queues are serviced first.  
- Core protocols in small networks: [[HTTP]], [[HTTPS]], [[DNS]], [[DHCP]], [[FTP]], [[SSH]], and [[Telnet]].  
- Capture a network [[Baseline Performance]] snapshot to benchmark future changes.  
- Cisco‚Äôs six-step troubleshooting method plus tools like [[Ping]], [[Traceroute]], and IOS *show*/*debug* commands speed fault isolation.  
- Comprehensive documentation, device inventory, budget forecasting, and traffic analysis are the pillars of growth planning.  
- Watch for [[Duplex Mismatch]] on links; mismatches cripple performance and are visible with *show* commands.

# Essay Questions
<details><summary>Compare and contrast network design considerations for a small business versus a large enterprise.</summary>

**Answer**  
*Cost:* SMBs work within tight budgets, so commodity hardware and minimal redundancy prevail; enterprises can afford modular chassis, multiple uplinks, and high-end firewalls.  
*Management:* SMBs may outsource or rely on part-time IT staff; enterprises employ dedicated teams and NMS platforms.  
*Scalability:* Small designs start flat (single VLAN, static routing) but must document for growth; enterprises deploy hierarchical layers and dynamic routing from day 1.  
*Redundancy:* SMBs might protect only the Internet edge, while enterprises duplicate core, links, and power to reach ‚Äúfive nines.‚Äù  
</details>

<details><summary>Discuss the importance of documentation and traffic analysis when planning for network scalability.</summary>

**Answer**  
Documentation (physical/logical diagrams, address plans) prevents guess-work and reveals bottlenecks. Traffic analysis (protocol captures, baseline utilization) shows which applications consume bandwidth now and predicts future needs. Together they justify budgets, size new links, and avoid over- or under-provisioning when the network grows.
</details>

<details><summary>Explain the Cisco six-step troubleshooting methodology with an example.</summary>

**Answer**  
1. *Identify the problem* ‚Äì Users report slow file transfers.  
2. *Establish a theory* ‚Äì Suspect duplex mismatch on the switch port.  
3. *Test the theory* ‚Äì Run `show interfaces`; port shows half-duplex/late collisions.  
4. *Establish a plan & implement* ‚Äì Force full-duplex on both ends during maintenance window.  
5. *Verify & prevent* ‚Äì Transfers normal; enable auto-negotiation reminders in SOP.  
6. *Document findings* ‚Äì Update ticket and knowledge base article.  
</details>

<details><summary>Describe host and IOS tools/commands for verifying connectivity.</summary>

**Answer**  
Hosts: `ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`, `arp -a`, `nslookup`, `ifconfig`/`ip addr`.  
IOS: `show running-config`, `show ip interface brief`, `show ip route`, `show cdp neighbors`, `ping`, `traceroute`, and `debug` family commands for real-time insight.
</details>

<details><summary>Analyse the role of common network protocols (HTTP, DHCP, DNS, FTP) in a small network.</summary>

**Answer**  
HTTP/HTTPS enable web access and cloud apps; DHCP automates IP assignment, reducing admin load; DNS translates names to IPs for every service; FTP/SFTP provide file transfer and backup. Their proper operation is vital‚Äîif DNS fails, even working IP connectivity feels ‚Äúdown,‚Äù underscoring protocol inter-dependence in troubleshooting.
