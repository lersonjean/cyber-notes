# Quiz

<details>
<summary>Explain the primary function of the OSI Application Layer.</summary>
The OSI Application Layer serves as the interface between user applications and network services, allowing applications to communicate over the network.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do the OSI Presentation and Session layers contribute to the functionality of the TCP/IP Application layer?</summary>
The Presentation layer handles data formatting, compression, and encryption, while the Session layer manages communication dialogue. Both functions are integrated into the TCP/IP Application layer.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the key difference between client-server and peer-to-peer networking models.</summary>
In a client-server model, a dedicated server provides resources to clients. In a peer-to-peer network, each device can act as both a client and a server.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the purpose of the HTTP GET request?</summary>
To retrieve data, such as a web page or file, from a web server.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Which email protocol is used to send email, and what port does it typically use?</summary>
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) typically uses TCP port 25.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explain why IMAP is preferred over POP when using multiple devices.</summary>
IMAP keeps copies of emails on the server, enabling synchronization across multiple devices.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the primary role of DNS in a network?</summary>
To translate human-readable domain names into numeric IP addresses used by computers.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Name two types of records commonly found in DNS.</summary>
A records (IPv4), MX records (mail servers). Other valid answers include AAAA and NS records.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the main function of DHCP.</summary>
Automatically assigns IP configuration parameters (IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers) to devices.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Briefly explain the difference between the control and data connections in FTP.</summary>
The control connection (port 21) manages commands and responses, while the data connection (port 20) transfers file data.
</details>

# Essay Questions

<details>
<summary>Compare and contrast the client-server and peer-to-peer networking models.</summary>
Client-server networks involve dedicated servers providing resources to requesting clients, ensuring centralized control, easier management, and scalability. Drawbacks include potential bottlenecks at the server. Peer-to-peer networks allow direct resource sharing among devices, distributing workloads but complicating management, security, and reliability. Ideal for small, decentralized applications such as file-sharing services.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explain HTTP and HTTPS roles in web communication.</summary>
HTTP transfers unencrypted web content, while HTTPS encrypts data for secure communication. Common request types include GET (data retrieval), POST (data submission), and PUT (resource uploads). HTTPS is essential for security in sensitive communications such as banking.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Discuss SMTP, POP, and IMAP functionalities and scenarios.</summary>
SMTP sends emails (TCP port 25). POP downloads emails and removes them from the server, ideal for single-device usage. IMAP synchronizes email copies across multiple devices, suitable for modern multi-device environments.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the roles of DNS and DHCP in network functionality.</summary>
DNS translates domain names to IP addresses, essential for user-friendly navigation. DHCP dynamically assigns IP configurations, streamlining device connectivity. Both services enable efficient and seamless network operations.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Detail the DHCPv4 process (DORA).</summary>
Client broadcasts DHCPDISCOVER, server unicasts DHCPOFFER, client broadcasts DHCPREQUEST, and server unicasts DHCPACK to finalize IP address assignment.
</details>

# FAQ

> [!info] **How does DNS resolve domain names?**  
> DNS queries hierarchical servers (root, TLD, second-level) to translate domain names into IP addresses, using records such as A, AAAA, MX, and NS. `nslookup` queries DNS manually.

> [!info] **Static vs Dynamic IP addresses?**  
> Static IPs are manually set for fixed devices like servers. Dynamic IPs, managed by DHCP, suit end-user devices for efficient IP management.

> [!info] **FTP functionality and ports?**  
> FTP transfers files via control (port 21, commands) and data (port 20, file transfer) connections, facilitating flexible file transfers.

> [!info] **SMB functions?**  
> SMB enables file/printer sharing, session management, and resource access on networks, primarily in Windows environments, through sustained client-server connections.
