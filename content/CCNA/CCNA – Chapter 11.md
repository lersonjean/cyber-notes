# Key Concepts 🔑
- <strong>IPv4 Address</strong>es are 32‑bit numbers written in dotted‑decimal form and divided into a <strong>Network Portion</strong> and <strong>Host Portion</strong> to enable hierarchical routing.  
- A <strong>Subnet Mask</strong> (or its <strong>Prefix Length (Slash Notation)</strong>) identifies how many leading bits belong to the network; an **IP AND mask** yields the <strong>Network Address</strong>.  
- Address types include <strong>Unicast</strong>, <strong>Broadcast</strong>, and <strong>Multicast</strong>, each serving one‑to‑one, one‑to‑all, and one‑to‑group communication respectively.  
- <strong>Private IP Addresses</strong> (RFC 1918) combined with <strong>NAT (Network Address Translation)</strong> conserve public space by translating internal hosts to public addresses.  
- <strong>CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)</strong> and <strong>Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)</strong> replace fixed classful masks, letting admins “borrow” host bits to create subnets that fit real needs.  
- A <strong>Broadcast Domain</strong> is bounded by routers or VLANs; breaking it up through <strong>Subnetting</strong> improves performance and security.  
- A documented <strong>Structured IP Address Design</strong> plan—mixing DHCP, static assignments, and DMZ layout—prevents duplicates, aids ACLs, and scales with growth.  

# Quiz
<details>
<summary>1. Describe the structure of an IPv4 address.</summary>
An IPv4 address is a 32‑bit number split into four 8‑bit octets, shown in dotted‑decimal (0‑255 per octet); it contains a network and a host portion.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. What is the purpose of a subnet mask?</summary>
A 32‑bit value of consecutive 1s then 0s that, via a bitwise AND with the IP, reveals the network address and separates network from host bits.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Explain unicast vs. broadcast vs. multicast.</summary>
Unicast = one‑to‑one; Broadcast = one‑to‑all on a LAN; Multicast = one‑to‑selected group that has joined the multicast address.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Primary function of NAT for private addresses?</summary>
It translates many internal private IPs to one (or a few) public IPs so private hosts can access the Internet despite not being globally routable.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Why was CIDR developed?</summary>
To replace rigid classful /8 /16 /24 networks, allowing variable prefix lengths and finer address allocation that reduces wasted IPv4 space.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. What is a broadcast domain and how can it be partitioned?</summary>
A Layer‑2 area where all devices receive broadcasts; routers or VLANs segment it into smaller domains.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. How do you calculate subnets and usable hosts when borrowing bits?</summary>
Subnets = 2^borrowed bits. Usable hosts = 2^remaining host bits − 2 (network & broadcast addresses).
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Define VLSM and its importance.</summary>
Variable‑Length Subnet Masking lets different subnets inside one block use different masks, matching address space to actual host counts and cutting waste.
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. List the three RFC 1918 private IPv4 ranges.</summary>
10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16.
</details>

<details>
<summary>10. Why is structured IP address design important?</summary>
It prevents duplicates, streamlines troubleshooting, supports access control/monitoring, and allows for scalable future growth.
</details>

# Essay Questions

- Compare <strong>Unicast</strong>, <strong>Broadcast</strong>, and <strong>Multicast</strong> addressing with real‑world protocol examples.  
- Explain public vs. <strong>Private IP Addresses</strong> and why <strong>NAT (Network Address Translation)</strong> is essential. Include static, dynamic, and PAT variations.  
- Detail the step‑by‑step process of subnetting a /24 into /26 networks, showing calculations for network, broadcast, and usable host ranges.

# FAQ
> [!faq] What is the fundamental structure of an IPv4 address and its subnet mask?  
> An IPv4 address is 32 bits (four octets, 0‑255) split into network and host parts.  
> A subnet mask is a 32‑bit string of 1s then 0s that marks those parts; its prefix length (e.g., /24) equals the count of 1s.

> [!faq] How do you determine the network and host portions of an IPv4 address?  
> Perform a bitwise AND between the IP and mask; the result is the network address. Bits under 1s are network bits; under 0s are host bits.

> [!faq] What are the three IPv4 communication types?  
> **Unicast** (one‑to‑one), **Broadcast** (one‑to‑all in a broadcast domain), **Multicast** (one‑to‑many group members).

> [!faq] Why use private addresses and how are they different from public?  
> Private addresses (RFC 1918) aren’t routed on the Internet and are translated via NAT, conserving the limited global public space.

> [!faq] How does subnetting enable network segmentation?  
> By borrowing host bits you create multiple subnets, each its own broadcast domain; routers then separate traffic and enforce policies.

> [!faq] How do you calculate subnets and usable hosts?  
> Subnets = 2^borrowed bits; usable hosts = 2^remaining host bits − 2 (network & broadcast).

> [!faq] Why is VLSM efficient?  
> It lets different segments use masks sized to their actual host counts, minimizing wasted addresses and enhancing scalability.

> [!faq] What factors shape a structured IP design plan?  
> Preventing duplicates, simplifying ACLs/monitoring, planning DHCP vs. static, DMZ layout, NAT strategy, and future growth projections.

# Chapter Summary
- IPv4 uses 32‑bit addresses split into network and host sections indicated by a subnet mask or prefix length.  
- CIDR and VLSM let networks use variable masks, reducing address waste compared to classful schemes.  
- Private RFC 1918 ranges with NAT allow thousands of internal hosts to share limited public space.  
- Subnetting (borrowing host bits) partitions a broadcast domain, improving performance and enabling security policies.  
- Proper IP design—including DHCP, static allocation, and documented address plans—avoids conflicts and eases growth.  
- Knowing how to calculate subnets, hosts, and address boundaries is critical for network implementation and troubleshooting.
