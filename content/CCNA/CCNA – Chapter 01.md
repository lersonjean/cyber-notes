# Key Concepts üîë
- Modern networks form the backbone of global communication across the [[Internet]], enabling instant, border‚Äëfree sharing of data, voice‚ÄØand video.  
- Every end device (or [[Host]]) uses a Network Interface Card ([[NIC]]) to connect to the network, while intermediary devices (switches, routers, firewalls) steer traffic.  
- Network structure is documented with both **physical** and **logical** [[Topology]] diagrams, each showing different but complementary views.  
- A [[LAN]] serves a small geographic area at high speeds; multiple LANs link together over service‚Äëprovider infrastructure to form a [[WAN]].  
- Converged networks carry voice, video and data on the same cables; maintaining quality demands robust [[QoS]] mechanisms.  
- A **reliable** design balances [[Fault Tolerance]], [[Scalability]], QoS and Security to keep services available despite failures or growth.  
- Current trends such as [[BYOD]], cloud computing, IoT and online collaboration reshape network design and security policies daily.

# Quiz
<details>
<summary>1. Explain the difference between a server and a client in a network context.</summary>
A **[[Server]]** provides resources or services‚Äîsuch as files or websites‚Äîwhile a **[[Client]]** is the device or software that requests and consumes those services.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. What are the main characteristics of a peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer network?</summary>
Each device acts as both server and client, sharing its own resources directly. Setup is simple and inexpensive, but security, scalability and performance are limited because there is no central administration.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. List three examples of intermediary networking devices.</summary>
Switches, routers and wireless access points (firewalls are another common intermediary).
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. What is the primary purpose of a Network Interface Card (NIC)?</summary>
The NIC provides the physical interface that allows a device to connect‚Äîwired or wirelessly‚Äîto a network medium and transmit/receive frames.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Distinguish between a physical topology and a logical topology.</summary>
A **physical topology** shows actual device locations and cabling; a **logical topology** shows how data flows, including addressing and port information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. What is the main difference between a Local Area Network (LAN) and a Wide Area Network (WAN)?</summary>
A [[LAN]] covers a small area and is owned/managed by one organisation; a [[WAN]] spans large areas, interconnecting multiple LANs, and is typically provisioned via service providers.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Define the concept of a converged network.</summary>
A converged network carries multiple traffic types‚Äîvoice, video and traditional data‚Äîover the same Ethernet‚Äëbased infrastructure using a unified protocol set.
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Identify two essential characteristics of a reliable network architecture.</summary>
Fault tolerance (redundant paths) and scalability (ability to grow). [[QoS]] and security are also key reliability pillars.
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. What is BYOD and how does it relate to modern networking trends?</summary>
**[[BYOD]]** (‚ÄúBring Your Own Device‚Äù) allows users‚Äô personal devices onto corporate networks, raising productivity but introducing new security and management challenges.
</details>

<details>
<summary>10. Name one security solution used in enterprise networks that might not be common in a home network.</summary>
An Intrusion Prevention System (**[[IPS]]**) is common in enterprises but rarely deployed in home environments.
</details>

# Essay Questions
<details>
<summary>1. Discuss the ways in which modern networking has fundamentally changed global communication and collaboration.</summary>

Digital networks have transformed communication by removing geographical barriers. Voice‚Äëover‚ÄëIP, video conferencing platforms and social‚Äëmedia ecosystems allow instant, rich interaction among individuals and organisations worldwide. Enterprises now rely on cloud‚Äëhosted applications that workers can reach from virtually any location, while collaboration suites such as WebEx‚ÄØ/‚ÄØZoom let dispersed teams co‚Äëcreate in real time. This connectivity underpins telemedicine, remote learning and e‚Äëcommerce‚Äîindustries that could not scale globally without reliable, converged IP networks.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Compare and contrast client‚Äëserver networks and peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer networks.</summary>

In a **client‚Äëserver** architecture, dedicated servers host resources and enforce security; centralisation streamlines backups, updates and policy control, making the model highly scalable and performant for medium‚Äëto‚Äëlarge environments. However, servers add cost and complexity.  
**Peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer** networks excel in simplicity and cost for very small groups: every host simultaneously requests and shares resources. Yet without central management they suffer from weak security, duplicate data, poor scalability and unpredictable performance. Use cases therefore diverge‚Äîenterprise environments favour client‚Äëserver, ad‚Äëhoc or home labs may adopt peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer for quick sharing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Explain the core features of a reliable network architecture and how they contribute to performance and availability.</summary>

- **Fault Tolerance:** Redundant links and devices allow alternate paths so traffic keeps flowing after a failure.  
- **Scalability:** Modular design and hierarchical layout enable seamless expansion without re‚Äëarchitecting or degrading throughput.  
- **Quality of Service (QoS):** Classification and queuing prioritise delay‚Äësensitive traffic (voice, video), ensuring quality even during congestion.  
- **Security:** Confidentiality, integrity and availability safeguards‚Äîimplemented via ACLs, firewalls, [[VPN]]s and IPS‚Äîprotect data and services from threats.  
Together, these traits deliver consistent, high‚Äëavailability performance as demand or conditions change.

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Describe the various types of internet connections available for home/small office and business use.</summary>

Home/SOHO users typically select between Cable, DSL, Cellular (4G/5G), Satellite or legacy Dial‚Äëup; availability, speed, cost and local infrastructure guide the choice. Businesses demand higher bandwidth and uptime, turning to Dedicated Leased Lines (e.g., T1/T3, Ethernet over fiber), Metro Ethernet, symmetric DSL and enterprise Satellite services‚Äîoften governed by Service Level Agreements (SLAs) guaranteeing latency, jitter and repair times.

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Analyse current networking trends (BYOD, online collaboration, video communication, cloud computing, IoT) and their impact on network design and security.</summary>

- **BYOD** multiplies endpoint diversity, prompting granular access controls and robust wireless coverage.  
- **Online collaboration & video** require assured bandwidth and end‚Äëto‚Äëend QoS, influencing capacity planning.  
- **Cloud computing** shifts data and applications off‚Äësite, driving resilient Internet paths, redundant data‚Äëcenter peering and encrypted tunnels.  
- **IoT** floods networks with small, often insecure devices, necessitating segmentation and strict device‚Äëprofiling.  
Collectively, these trends push architects toward converged, programmable and highly secure infrastructures.
