# Key Concepts ðŸ”‘
- The **Network Layer** enables end devices to exchange data across multiple networks by encapsulating transport-layer segments into packets.
- Four core operations: **<strong>Device Addressing</strong>**, **<strong>Encapsulation</strong>**, **<strong>Decapsulation</strong>**, and **<strong>Routing</strong>**.
- IP is **Connectionless**, offers **Best-effort delivery**, and is **Media-independent**.
- **IPv4** header fields include Version, **<strong>Differentiated Services (QoS)</strong>**, **<strong>Header Checksum</strong>**, **Time to Live (TTL)**, Protocol, Source & Destination Addresses; IPv4 faces address depletion and relies on NAT.
- **IPv6** improvements: 128-bit addressing, fixed 40-byte header (no checksum or fragmentation fields), optional **<strong>Extension Headers</strong>**, restored end-to-end connectivity.
- Host routing logic: loopback vs. local vs. remote determination via subnet mask; use of **<strong>Default Gateway</strong>**.
- Router forwarding: routing table entries (Connected, Static, Dynamic, Default), **Longest-prefix match**, `show ip route` codes.

# Quiz
<details>
<summary>What is the primary purpose of the network layer?</summary>
The primary purpose of the network layer is to enable end devices to exchange data across multiple networks.
</details>

<details>
<summary>List the four basic operations performed at the network layer.</summary>
Device addressing, encapsulation, routing, and decapsulation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what it means for IP to be "connectionless".</summary>
No dedicated session is set up before packets are sent; each packet is treated independently.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is "best-effort delivery" in the context of the network layer?</summary>
The network layer does not guarantee packet arrival, order, or error recovery; it simply attempts delivery.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does IP demonstrate "media independence"?</summary>
IP operates over any underlying Layer 2 technology or physical medium without caring about specifics.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Identify two important fields found in an IPv4 packet header.</summary>
Source IP Address and Destination IP Address.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why was IPv6 developed?</summary>
To overcome IPv4 address depletion, restore end-to-end connectivity, and simplify packet headers.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the function of the Time to Live (TTL) or Hop Limit field?</summary>
Prevents packets from looping indefinitely by decrementing at each router; discards when it reaches zero.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does a host device determine if a destination is local or remote?</summary>
By comparing the destination IP and subnet mask to its own; matching network ID = local, else remote.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the role of the default gateway for a host?</summary>
Serves as the exit point for remote destinations; forwards packets to other networks.

> [!info] **What is a default gateway and why is it important?**  
> A Layer 3 device on the local network that forwards packets to other networks, enabling internet and inter-LAN communication.

> [!info] **How do routers make forwarding decisions for packets?**  
> By examining the destination IP, matching the best (longest-prefix) route in their routing table, and sending it out the corresponding interface.

> [!info] **What information is typically found in a router's routing table?**

# Chapter Summary
- The Network Layerâ€™s four functionsâ€”Device Addressing, Encapsulation, Decapsulation, and Routingâ€”are essential for inter-network communication.  
- IPâ€™s connectionless, best-effort, media-independent design simplifies transport across diverse links.  
- IPv4â€™s fields and limitations (address depletion, NAT) led to IPv6â€™s 128-bit addressing, fixed header, and extension headers.  
- Hosts use subnet masks to distinguish local vs. remote traffic and forward remote packets to a Default Gateway.  
- Routers consult routing tables (Connected, Static, Dynamic, Default) and use longest-prefix match to forward packets efficiently.
